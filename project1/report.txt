Project Status:
Version 1, 2, 3 appear to work with no errors or leaks from the tests I attempted to write myself.
Version 4 I did not have enough time to work out a good display system, it compiles and shows the first row of the table but needed more time.

Help:
I read others questions in discord/slack and listened in during office hours but no one in particular really gave me any specific advice.
